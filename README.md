## ðŸ“… **Day 1: Setup + Data Exploration**

### **28th April 2025**

- [x]  Install/verify Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
- [x]  Download Titanic Dataset from Kaggle.
- [x]  Load dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- [x]  Check:
    - [x]  `.head()`
    - [x]  `.info()`
    - [x]  `.describe()`
- [x]  Identify missing values.
- [x]  Plot:
    - [x]  Histogram (e.g., Age, Fare)
    - [x]  Countplot (e.g., Survival)
    - [x]  Boxplot (e.g., Age vs Pclass)
- [ ]  Summarize key insights in 3â€“5 bullet points.

## ðŸ“… **Day 2: Build Basic ML Pipeline**

### **29th April 2025**

- [x]  Handle missing data (e.g., `SimpleImputer`).
- [x]  Encode categorical variables (`LabelEncoding`/`OneHotEncoding`).
- [x]  Remove the columns which have all the data values as 0.
- [x]  Perform Train-Test split.
- [x]  Train a Logistic Regression model.
- [x]  Predict on test data.
- [x]  Evaluate:
    - [x]  Confusion Matrix
    - [x]  Accuracy Score
- [x]  Save your notebook (`Day2_Titanic_Model.ipynb`).

- [x]  apna(DMP) Problem Statement Selection
- [x]  Pre-approval Report for SSIP
- [x]  Annexure-1 for SSIP
- [x]  Budget for FarmFlow

## ðŸ“… **Day 3: Feature Engineering + Model Improvement**

### **30th April 2025**

- [x]  Create new features (e.g., Title extracted from Name).
- [x]  Train a Random Forest Classifier.
- [x]  Perform Cross-Validation (`cross_val_score`).
- [x]  Compare results: Logistic Regression vs Random Forest.
- [x]  Save improved notebook (`Day3_Titanic_Improved.ipynb`).
